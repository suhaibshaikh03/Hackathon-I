## Prompt

conclude the project well with giving reader's call to action

## Response snapshot

I have successfully enhanced the conclusion of the Autonomous Humanoid capstone module with a compelling call to action. The specification now includes:

1. An expanded "Project Completion and Community Engagement" section that emphasizes the significance of the student's achievement
2. Clear next steps for sharing and continuing their journey in Physical AI
3. A motivational message that positions the student as a creator in the field of Physical AI
4. A forward-looking question that encourages continued innovation

The updated conclusion reinforces that students have completed a comprehensive journey from digital AI agents to fully embodied autonomous systems, and encourages them to share their work, join the community, continue learning, consider commercial applications, and mentor others.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Enhanced project conclusion with strong call to action
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/6-autonomous-humanoid/spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for project completion
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully added motivational conclusion encouraging community engagement and continued innovation.
