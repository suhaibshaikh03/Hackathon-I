11. The three main components are: Perception (vision/environment understanding), Cognition (language understanding and planning), and Action (motion control and execution).

12. Challenges include ambiguity in natural language, ensuring plan feasibility, handling incomplete information, and maintaining safety constraints.

13. Perception provides environmental awareness and state information necessary for the robot to understand its surroundings and make informed decisions.

14. High-level planning decomposes tasks and manages goals; low-level planning generates specific motor commands and trajectories.

15. Real-time adaptation continuously monitors execution feedback and environmental changes, adjusting plans dynamically to maintain success.
